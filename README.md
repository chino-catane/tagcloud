## Word Cloud

## Description

* The visualization is based on the frequency of the word. Larger the frequency, bigger the word is.
* The word cloud is generated by python and this image is given as source to HTML through flask and made interactive.
*Upon hovering, the frequency of that word in the text will be displayed and upon clicking, the corresponding wikipedia page will be opened.
